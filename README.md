<h1 align=center>Beautiful Katamari — Nintendo Switch port</h1>

A native Nintendo Switch port of the Xbox 360 version of **Beautiful Katamari** (Namco Bandai Games, 2007), with its
downloadable content.

It's not an emulator. The PowerPC code of the game's `default.xex` is statically recompiled to C++ with
[ReXGlue](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk) and compiled for the Switch, and the game's Direct3D calls are drawn
directly on the Switch GPU's own API, deko3d, by [reNut](https://github.com/masterspike52/reNut)'s Direct3D-level renderer.

> [!NOTE]
> You need your own copy of the Xbox 360 disc (a disc image, `.iso`; the NTSC-U release). The DLC packages
> (`Content/<profile>/4E4D07DC/00000002`) are optional.

## How to install

1. Open the installer page: **https://chanseyisthebest.github.io/katamari-nx-installer/**
2. Choose your game: its **disc image** (`.iso`; you can choose the DLC package files along with it) or a **folder** you
   extracted the game into. Then press **Create katamari-nx.zip**. Everything runs in your browser and the game files
   never leave your computer: the page checks your copy, downloads the build and makes the shaders from your game's own
   files.
3. Extract the downloaded `katamari-nx.zip` into `sdmc:/switch/`.

Your `katamari-nx` folder should look like this:

```text
/switch/katamari-nx/
  katamari-nx.nro
  LICENSES.txt
  katamari.toml             (your settings; written at the first start when it is missing)
  deko3d_glsl.bin           (the game's shaders, made from your copy)
  game_root/                (the files of your disc)
  dlc/                      (optional: the DLC packages, installed by the game at its first start)
```

The game adds `deko3d_shaders.bin` and `pipeline_list.bin` there as you play (the shaders compiled for the Switch GPU, and
the list of what it drew, so later sessions prepare it ahead).

Launch it with a game override (hold **R** while starting an installed title) or a forwarder. Album applet mode does not
give the game enough memory. If you use a forwarder, set it to a **39-bit address space**.

To build everything yourself instead, see [docs/building.md](docs/building.md).

> [!NOTE]
> **Updating:** open the installer page again and press **Create katamari-nx-update.zip**. It only holds the new
> `katamari-nx.nro` and the shaders, so there is no need to copy the game again: extract it over your folder. Your
> `katamari.toml`, your saves and the game files stay.

> [!CAUTION]
> **The first time you play** after installing or updating, the game compiles its shaders for the Switch GPU as it meets
> them, so **IT CAN STUTTER for a moment** in new places. They are saved next to the NRO (`deko3d_shaders.bin`) and later
> sessions start smoothly.

## Controls

By default the face buttons work **by position, as on the Xbox 360 pad** the game was made for: the bottom button is the
Xbox's A, the right one is the Xbox's B, and so on.

<div align="center">

| Switch | Xbox 360 |
| --- | --- |
| B (bottom) | A |
| A (right) | B |
| Y (left) | X |
| X (top) | Y |
| ZR / ZL | RT / LT |
| R / L | RB / LB |
| + | Start |
| − | Back |
| Sticks / D-pad | Sticks / D-pad |

</div>

To use the buttons by letter instead (the Switch's A acts as A), set `input_xbox_layout = false` in `katamari.toml`.

**Two players:** every controller is its own player, in the order they connect. The console in handheld mode counts as
one, so handheld + a Pro Controller makes players 1 and 2. Single Joy-Cons are held sideways, one per player (SL and SR
are the triggers). **L + R + ZR** opens the system's controller screen to connect, reorder, or split a Joy-Con pair.

**Remapping:** each player has a button map in `katamari.toml` (`[input_p1]` and `[input_p2]`).

## Settings

`katamari.toml`, next to the NRO, holds only your options. Everything else is built into the NRO.

<div align="center">

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `msaa_level` | Samples per pixel of the game's edge smoothing: `4` (the game's own, default), `2` or `1` (off). Fewer gives rougher edges and less GPU work |
| `frame_cap` | Frame rate cap: `"Off"` (the game's own, uncapped as on the Xbox 360, default) or `"30"` |
| `user_language` | The game's language: `1` English (default), `2` Japanese |
| `katamari_dlc_unlock_packs` | Also load the DLC packs that only unlock what the game itself unlocks: Accessory Sets A-D, Character Sets A-D, Special Accessory (`false`, default). The stage packs always load |
| `input_xbox_layout` | Face buttons by position (`true`, default) or by letter (`false`) |
| `input_joycon_sideways` | Single Joy-Cons held sideways, one per player (`true`, default) |
| `input_joycon_sideways_stick` | With it, a single Joy-Con's stick turned for the sideways grip (`true`, default) |
| `[input_p1]`, `[input_p2]` | Each player's buttons: for every Xbox button, the Switch buttons that press it, e.g. `a = "B, ZR"` |

</div>

If you delete `katamari.toml`, the game writes the default one again at the next start.

## Performance

The port runs at the console's stock clocks on three cores, 720 lines in handheld and 1080 docked. The released NRO is
built with link-time optimisation and PGO from a console session of this version. The hub and the menus hold 60 fps; the
biggest stages drop well below that (19-47 fps in the last console profile before 1.0.0's optimisations of those stages:
[docs/console-rc9-breakdown.md](docs/console-rc9-breakdown.md)). Every optimisation was compared with the original
functions on the PC, call by call: the measurements are in [docs/katamari-notes.md](docs/katamari-notes.md).

## How it works

- **The game's code is translated, not emulated.** [ReXGlue](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk) translates every
  function of the game's program to C++, which is then compiled for the Switch. ReXGlue also gives the game what it
  expects from an Xbox 360: its system, files, audio and controllers.
- **A Direct3D-level renderer on deko3d.** The game's Direct3D calls are replaced by
  [reNut](https://github.com/masterspike52/reNut)'s renderer (as the Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts port adapted it), which
  draws them with [plume](https://github.com/renderbag/plume) on [deko3d](https://github.com/devkitPro/deko3d), the Switch
  GPU's own API: no GPU command stream is written or parsed and no EDRAM is modelled.
- **Shaders made from your copy.** Beautiful Katamari keeps its 195 shaders in `default.xex` and in the models of its data
  files. The installer page takes them from your copy and makes `deko3d_glsl.bin` in your browser: Renut's
  [XenosRecomp](https://github.com/hedge-dev/XenosRecomp) translates each one to HLSL, DXC compiles it to SPIR-V,
  [SPIRV-Cross](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross) turns that into GLSL and banjo-nx's passes trim it. The console
  compiles each one with [uam](https://github.com/devkitPro/uam) the first time it is used and keeps the result. The NRO
  itself holds no shader of the game.
- **Hand-written and machine-optimised functions.** The game's hottest functions run as native ARM code written for them
  (`app/src/cpu/hot`), and 1,387 more as optimised machine copies; each one was checked against the generated original.
