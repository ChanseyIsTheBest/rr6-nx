# Console run of rc3 (2026-10-31 09:03-09:11): performance breakdown

The logs in `builds/2026-10-30_2105_rc2_diet_dof/COPY_TO_SD_switch_katamari-nx/logs` are from **rc3** (they show the
16 DLC installs at 09:03:10; rc2 has no DLC installer), so they are symbolised against
`builds/2026-10-31_0030_rc3_dlc_full/katamari-nx.elf`. Set-up: ReverseNX docked mode with handheld clocks (CPU
1020 MHz, GPU 460 MHz, memory 1600 MHz), so the port renders at 1920x1080 (the docked size) on the handheld GPU clock.

## Frame rate, render thread and GPU, every 10 s

| Time | Where | Game fps | Render thread ms/frame | GPU ms/frame |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 09:03:28-09:05:18 | logos, opening movie, title, menus | 50-60 | 0.7-1.5 | 6-8 |
| 09:05:28 | loading into the level | 38 | 3.5 | 19 |
| 09:05:38-09:06:58 | first level | 28.5-30.9 | 6.2-8.7 | 32-34.5 |
| 09:07:08-09:08:48 | first level, larger ball | 23.6-29.4 | 7.3-12.8 | 33.5-40.6 |
| 09:09:08-09:09:39 | results, menus | 58-60 | 0.7-1.0 | 7.8-8.7 |
| 09:10:09-09:11:40 | second level | 33-34.7 | 2.7-3.8 | 24-28.4 |
| 09:11:42 | crash leaving the collection menu (fixed for rc4) | | | |

**Gameplay is GPU-bound.** The GPU needs 24-40 ms a frame at 460 MHz and 1080p; the busiest CPU thread is 62 % busy.
At the docked GPU clock (768 MHz) the same frames would take roughly 14-24 ms. CPU work does not raise this frame
rate; GPU work, a lower resolution or the docked clock does.

A gameplay GPU frame (09:06:28, 34.2 ms): 9.0 ms one full-screen pass (PS 35DB0C4B, 2 draws), 6.3 ms the 410
blended draws a frame of PS 0C4AF44C (the level's objects), 5.1 ms colour resolves, 3.7 ms PS 6DAE04AD (14 draws),
3.4 ms depth resolves, 1.3 ms PS 464A90A8, the rest under 1 ms each.

## CPU by thread, gameplay (33 reports under 45 fps, mean 29.9 fps)

Share of each thread's samples. "hand" = hand-written natives, "machine" = machine-optimised copies (localized + bulk),
"generated" = plain recompiled code (not optimised), the rest host code.

All threads together: 275 % of the four cores' 400 %. Of that, machine-optimised copies 146 % of a core (53 %),
generated code 48 % (18 %), host runtime/kernel 44 % (16 %), host audio 17 % (6 %), libc 10 %, renderer 8 %,
hand-written natives 1.5 %.

The hand-written natives (matrix multiply, copies, hash) are 0.5 % of busy time in this run: the paths they won on
the PC and in Ryujinx are not where this console session spent its time.
