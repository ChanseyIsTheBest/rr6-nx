# Console run of rc9 (2026-11-01 14:20-14:58 and 21:26-21:27): performance breakdown

Handheld throughout (720p, CPU 1020 MHz, GPU 460.8 MHz, memory 1600 MHz), **three cores**, symbolised with
`builds/2026-11-01_1213_rc9_shaders_dlc/katamari-nx.elf`. The console slept twice: 14:27:45-14:47:24 and
14:58:36-21:26:47. The DLC list had the seven stage packs and hid the nine unlock packs.

The `rex_crash.log` that came with these logs is not from rc9. The faulting instruction it records (`brk #1000` at
image+0x2914, lr in sub_822AE650) is rc6's supermarket crash (sub_822AC470). In rc9's ELF that address holds a `bl`.
The file was still on the SD card from the rc6 run; rc7 fixed that crash.

**The M71_KDXSE stage is the slowest place so far: 27 fps on average, 19-30, with the GPU at 15-21 ms. It is
CPU-bound, by the game's main thread.**

## Threads and cores

The process has three cores (mask 0x7). The game's threads and most host threads may run on any of the three; the
system places them. Pinned threads:
- Renut's render thread: core 1 only, priority 0x2C (above the game's 0x3B, so it takes core 1 when it has work).
- The audio output thread and the UI thread: core 0 only.

The profile samples threads and does not record which core a sample ran on, so the per-core figures are the pinned
threads plus the floating ones' total.

| **All threads (of 300 %)** | | **237** | **199** | **231** | **130** | **234** | |

In the M71_KDXSE stage the three cores are two-thirds busy (199 of 300 %). The main thread fills one core by itself,
and the frame waits on it: the draw thread drops to 49 % because it has less to submit. A fourth core would not help
there; less work on the main thread would.

## CPU by thread (% of one core; the categories are shares of that thread's samples)

"hand" = hand-written natives, "machine" = machine-optimised copies, "not optimised" = plain recompiled code, the rest
host code (the port's own C++). Three cores = 300 %.

## Top functions, the M71_KDXSE stage (share of the thread's samples)

| Thread | Function | Share | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main | sub_82277E70 | 25.1 % | machine (its matrix multiplies are hand natives, inlined) |
| Main | sub_822683D0 | 21.3 % | machine |

| Draw | rex UpdateGuestClock | 2.9 % | host runtime (lock-free since rc6; still called ~300,000 times a second) |

The same two functions led rc5's first level (17.9 % and 14.3 % of the main thread). In this stage they take
**46 % of a main thread that is 101 % busy**, so they set the frame rate.

## Findings

1. **The M71_KDXSE stage runs at 19-30 fps, held back by the main thread.** sub_82277E70 and sub_822683D0 take 46 %
   of it. Both are machine copies; neither has a hand-written native of its own (sub_82277E70's matrix multiplies do).
   They are the targets for the next hand work.
2. **After a sleep, the timer thread replays every missed tick.** A repeating timer that is late adds one interval
   and fires again (`sdk/src/core/timer_queue.cpp`), so it calls the game's callback for every interval the console
   slept through. After the 20-minute sleep it used 44 % of a core for one report. After the 6.5-hour sleep it used
   66-88 % of a core for all 50 s logged, still catching up. Fix: a timer that is far behind fires once and goes on
   from the present.
3. Stages on three cores: the tutorial 40-46 fps, the 14:54 stage 29-47 fps.
4. Hub, menus and results: 60 fps.
5. The draw thread's UpdateGuestClock is 2.9 % (lock-free since rc6).
